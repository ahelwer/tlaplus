# Unified TLA⁺ Syntax Test Corpus

This collection of text files contains a large (182 at time of writing) number of TLA⁺ syntax tests.
The corpus originated as a set of tests for the tree-sitter-tlaplus grammar (found [here](https://github.com/tlaplus-community/tree-sitter-tlaplus) at time of writing) before being adapted for use with SANY as well.
All of the corpus files are duplicated here for archival & reproducibility reasons.
However, this also means it is possible for them to get out of sync with the files in the tree-sitter-tlaplus repository.
Therefore if you make a change to these files (updating or adding tests) ensure it is also made on the tree-sitter-tlaplus repository.
Efforts will be made to ensure changes to corpus tests in the tree-sitter-tlaplus repository find there way here as well.
